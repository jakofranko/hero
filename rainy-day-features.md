title: "Rainy Day Features"
layout: page
---

As I have been developing Justice, I pretty consistently start out to work on a certain number of features, get way into the weeds, and realize that I will never finish this game unless I move on to the next *game-play* feature. It's easy to get obsessed with the simulation of the world, and forget that the goal is to have a *game* that people will play. However, I don't want these ideas to be forgotten, and would love to either work on them myself one day, or have a way for other people to contribute to the game. The purpose of this page is to be a list of the things I don't want to forget, but want to save for a "rainy day."

* Park lots (with fountains and pretty gardens and trees and benches and ponds etc.)
* Unique geometry for skyscrapers (ovals, circles, hexagons etc., preferably generated by some sort of grammar)
* Loading screen that tracks what is currently being generated (plus some improvements to fix loops that are running too long)
* Migrate all files over to a RequireJS system
* Better captioning for menus (namely the action menu for putting things in containers)
* Work jobs that give the NPC money
* Convert all instances of `Math.random()` to `ROT.RNG.getUniform()`
* A more complex NPC generator that will build out super villains and/or event NPCs
* 'Event source' entity mixin that allows NPCs to spawn events as long as they are alive
