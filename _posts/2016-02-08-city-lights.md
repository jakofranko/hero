After looking over (rot.js's lighting capabilities)[http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/manual/#lighting] capabilities, I've decided that I have to implement this in the game. I want to have street lights that turn on at night, neon lights coming from some shop windows, and store lights streaming out of store windows. I think it could look really lovely, and wouldn't be that hard as long as I had a way of easily defining light sources for various types of furniture and tiles.

A more difficult feat would, I think, be having all the tiles get darker at night, and then getting brighter during the day.

Anyways, since this is a totally aesthetic thing (though I could certainly introduce a stealth mechanic that partially depending on light), this will be lower priority, methinks.
