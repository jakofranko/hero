Well, this is sort of a first for me, but I've had this idea for a roguelike stuck in my brain for a while. This will be a sort of developer blog as I get ideas and want to get them out, and since GitHub has Jekyll support for free, why not?

I guess to start, this project is heavily inspired by [Coding Cookies'](http://www.codingcookies.com/2013/05/03/building-a-roguelike-in-javascript-part-1/) tutorial that walks through building a roguelike using [ROT.js](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/). ROT.js will be my primary toolkit for building this game. The structure is, again, heavily inspired by the Coding Cookies tutorial, which in turn mirrors [Trystan's roguelike tutorial](http://trystans.blogspot.ca/2011/08/nameless-roguelike-for-tutorial.html) for Java and takes several queues from ROT.js creator Ondřej Žára's own [games](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/#games).

What I'm wanting to build is basically a super-hero roguelike. Procedurally generated city with crime events and evil-doers to stop, maybe eventually with missions. What has really captured my imaginiaton right now however is the procedural generation of the city, which will be the first thing I attempt to tackle.

This is just for fun, but I thought I might as well document things here and there as I go.
