I started losing a little steam on this; not much, but was felt like what I thought was so cool is starting to seem harder to achieve. So, I thought I would set some goals for myself to actually get some gameplay out. Hopefully, this will get some of my creative juices flowing and provide a motive for keeping things up! I don't intend to let this project slip away...

These are the gameplay features that I think are the bare minimum to get some gameplay that gets at the goal for this game. Without these features, there is no game. However, I think these goals are attainble in the short term, while leaving a ton of room for expansion.

# Version 0.10 Goals

* Justice meter that is influenced by the Crime meter, which is influenced by the number of criminals
* UI for viewing these stats
* Player character creation that allows for an allocation of points into HERO System-like Characteristics (The player will only be a melee character for now, and the STR characteristic will influence damage.
* Wandering Criminal NPCs that attack the player at night and that the player has to 'kill' to decrease the number of criminals
* Experience system for defeating criminals, and revamped UI for allocating experience points into statistics.

Once these things are in place, I think there will actually be a game. Once some basic gameplay is in place, I think I can start on other things like more buildings, civilian NPCs (and a much more complex social system with jobs, houses, places to live etc) and a power system for the PC to start to be able to choose powers.
